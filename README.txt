DIVS Chess
==========

Viktor (@vikisonlone) and I wrote this 3D chess program, complete with shitty
AI, in roughly half month during the end of 2009 and start of 2010. It was crunch time.

We [hosted the project on SF](https://sourceforge.net/projects/divschess/) after
we finished but never touched it. People are still downloading it!

Awesome features:

- Choose AI difficulty
- Editable board
- Basic move log
- Toggle graphics
- 3D graphics & move highlighting

I'm afraid to look at the code now. Please don't judge us on based on this old work.

Below is our original README!

Compilation: sh maker.sh
Run: ./chess

Use arrows/mousemovements while holding middle button to rotate view.
Use right click menu for game setting changes. (edit mode has to be toggled before editing can take place)
Left click on square to select piece, left click on new location where its supposed to move to.
Enjoy :D
